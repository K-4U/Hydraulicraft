[crafting{200,10,key=block/HPHydraulicPressureReservoir}]










The high pressure reservoir is like a controller for the system. Even though you CAN have a system without one, you still need this machine to pump fluid (either Water or Hydraulic Oil) into the system.

When broken it will retain its pressure and fluid level.
[comment{James 1-20 This is now covered in the pressurenetwork page not sure if it should be covered here as well
But when placed down, you need to realize that it needs to equalize the pressure over the entire network!}]

[comment{James 1-20 In my test world it changes based on pressure, not volume}]
This machine will output a redstone signal depending on how much pressure there is.

[comment{James 1-20 This is now mentioned on the baseconcepts briefly and in pressurenetwork pages
When using Hydraulic Oil, the network will not lose any fluid.
However, when you're still on water, you might need to think about giving it a steady supply of water.
Also, You cannot compress water that much. So the maximum pressure of a water based network lies lower than one
powered by Oil.}]
