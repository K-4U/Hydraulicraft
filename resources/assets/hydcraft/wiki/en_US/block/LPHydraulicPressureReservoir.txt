[crafting{200,10,key=block/LPHydraulicPressureReservoir}]










The low pressure reservoir is like the controller for the system. Even though you CAN have a system without one, you
still need this machine to pump fluid (either Water or Hydraulic Oil) into the system.

When broken it will retain its pressure and fluid level.
[comment{ James 7-20 this is covered in the baseconcept briefly, and in the pressurenetwork page in more detail
But when placed down, you need to realize that it needs to equalize the pressure over the entire network!
This machine will output a redstone signal depending on how full it is.
When using Hydraulic Oil, the network will not lose any fluid. However, when you're still on water, you might need to think about giving it a steady supply of water.
Also. You cannot compress water that much. So the maximum pressure of a water based network lies lower than one
powered by Oil.}]
